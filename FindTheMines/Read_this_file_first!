Logical part of the gane in the Board.java file is finished
Grafical part of the game is still under development.
There is a picture of the game how it should look like after the gui is finished.

DISCLAIMER:
Idea for the game isn't mine, I saw it in some add and had an idea
to make my own code to replicate the games logic in purpose of practicing
the logic and programming skills.
